    {Twisted Edwards Curves in Elliptic Curve Cryptography}
    {}
    {2015}
    {
         This tutorial introduces Twisted Edwards Curves and relates them to Edwards Curves and Montgomery Curves. It covers projective and other coordinate systems for Twisted Edwards Curves and discusses their application within the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.

    {Cellular Automata Encryption Generator}
    {}
    {2013}
    {
         This cellular automata encryption generator allows users to learn about CA encryption techniques in a visual manner. It allows the user to input any CA rule (mod 256) and set output preferences.

    {Awesome Library}
    {}
    {2013}
    {
         The idea of this discrete math library is to allow students to self-study various problems related to discrete math, such as set operations and relation classification. I created a 64-bit JavaScript number library which was used to automate question generation.
